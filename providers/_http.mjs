 * sweep — instead of each one re-deriving them independently.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT decide what happens when retries are exhausted: it
 * rethrows, and the caller chooses. That policy genuinely differs per provider
 * — workday truncates the tenant with a warning and keeps the pages it has,
 * while a16z must fail loudly rather than return a silent partial board. The
 * rethrown error carries `.attempts` (how many requests were actually made)
 * so a caller logging a summary doesn't have to assume the full `retries + 1`
 * — a non-retryable error can end the loop after just one.
 *
 * Nothing in the loop ever inspected the response body, so it is parameterised
 * by the request rather than duplicated per content type: `fetchJsonWithRetry`
 * and `fetchTextWithRetry` are the same policy over a different transport call.
 * Splitting them into two copies is how the entity decoders drifted (#1555,
