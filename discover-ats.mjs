/**
 * discover-ats.mjs — Company-list → scannable ATS board resolver for career-ops
 *
 * Takes a list of companies and resolves each to a scannable ATS board by
 * probing the public JSON APIs career-ops already supports (see VENDOR_ORDER)
 * via the existing providers/ layer — zero LLM tokens, zero auth. A company
 * "resolves" when a vendor's board exists AND currently lists ≥1 job.
 *
 * portals.yml is a USER-LAYER file, so by DEFAULT this command is preview-only:
 * it prints the entries it WOULD add (pendingEntries) and writes nothing. Pass
 * --write to explicitly opt in to appending them to portals.yml `tracked_companies`
 * (a text splice that preserves the file's comments and formatting; deduped;
 * idempotent; atomic temp-then-rename). Companies that don't resolve —
 * JS-rendered portals, non-standard slugs, or Workday without a hint — are
 * flagged for manual follow-up instead of being silently dropped.
 *
 * Input: a YAML file `companies: [{name, slug?, website?}]` (via --in), and/or
 * bare company names as positional CLI args.
 *
 * Run: node discover-ats.mjs --in companies.yml            (preview — writes nothing)
 *      node discover-ats.mjs --in companies.yml --write    (opt in: append to portals.yml)
 *      node discover-ats.mjs Stripe Ramp Mollie            (bare names)
 *      node discover-ats.mjs --in companies.yml --summary  (human table)
 *      node discover-ats.mjs --in companies.yml --vendors gh,ashby
 *      node discover-ats.mjs --self-test
 *
 * Probing hits live third-party APIs, so honor CAREER_OPS_PORTALS to point at a
 * scratch portals file during tests/experiments.
 *
 * Issue #1864 — github.com/santifer/career-ops

breezy, pinpoint, rippling, join (all resolve from a name/slug) and workday
(resolves from a coordinate hint — a name alone can't locate a Workday site).
Default: all of them, probed in that order, first match wins.
