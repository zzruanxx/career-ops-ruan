/**
 * set-status.mjs — canonical CLI to update a tracker row's status/note (#1428).
 *
 * data/applications.md is a shared surface with multiple readers and writers.
 * One canonical write path is safer than N agents hand-editing markdown, so
 * modes (apply Step 9, followup, batch) call this instead of editing the table.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node set-status.mjs <report#|company> <state> [--note "..."] [--role "..."] [--force] [--dry-run] [--json]
 *
 * Row resolution:
 *   - --row N     → exact match on the # column, stated explicitly
 *   - --report N  → match the row whose Report cell links report #N
 *   - numeric argument → exact match on the # column; if the tracker has a
 *     duplicate # (see #1704 — merge-tracker.mjs bug, now fixed, that could
 *     assign the same # to two rows), --role narrows it, otherwise it fails
 *     ambiguous with a candidate list instead of silently editing whichever
 *     row was found first
 *   - otherwise → company match (normalized, same key as merge-tracker dedup);
 *     multiple hits are narrowed with --role (fuzzy, role-matcher.mjs), and
 *     anything still ambiguous fails with a numbered candidate list.
 *
 * Why --row/--report exist:
 *   Tracker row IDs and report IDs are two independent counters sharing one
 *   number space. reserve-report-num.mjs treats tracker row IDs as occupied
 *   when allocating a report number, so the sequences leapfrog and never
 *   realign; every row added WITHOUT an evaluation report (backfilled rows,
 *   #1799) widens the gap permanently. A bare numeric selector is therefore
 *   genuinely ambiguous — "97" may mean row #97 or report #97, which are
 *   different applications — and the report-number-mismatch guard below fires
 *   on every such call once the counters have diverged. A guard that fires
 *   almost always trains callers to reach for --force, which disables it
 *   everywhere including the cases it was written for.
 *
 *   --row and --report remove the ambiguity instead of suppressing the check.
 *   Both state which number space the caller means, so the mismatch guard is
 *   skipped as ANSWERED rather than overridden — unlike --force, which
 *   silences it while the ambiguity is still real.
 *
 * State validation is strict against templates/states.yml (labels, ids, and
 * aliases resolve to the canonical label; anything else is rejected before the
 * tracker is touched). --note appends to the Notes cell with "; " and is
 * idempotent — re-running the same command is always safe.
 *
 * The read-modify-write runs under the shared tracker lock (tracker-utils.mjs,
 * same lock as merge-tracker.mjs) and the file is replaced atomically. Only the
 * Status and Notes cells of the matched row change; every other byte of the
 * tracker round-trips untouched.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 success (including no-op re-runs) · 1 usage error,
 * non-canonical state, unreadable states.yml, or non-retryable lock/write failure ·
 * 2 row not found or unreadable tracker · 3 ambiguous company match ·
 * 4 tracker lock timeout (busy — retry later).
 *
 * When the new status is Applied, the JSON output carries
 * `"followupSeedCandidate": true` — the hook point for seeding
 * data/follow-ups.md with the default cadence (#1430, not implemented here).
 *
 * Every real status change also appends one line to the transition ledger
 * (status-log.tsv, sibling of the tracker file):
 *   {tracker#}\t{date}\t{from}\t{to}\t{source}\t
 * Source is `set-status` unless --source names the caller delegating here.
 * Date defaults to today; pass --on YYYY-MM-DD when the transition actually
 * happened earlier ("they replied Tuesday"). The append is observation-only:
 * if it fails, a warning goes to stderr and the exit code is unchanged — the
 * tracker remains the source of truth for state. Read by funnel-velocity.mjs.
 *
 * Two rules the reader enforces that this writer never has to think about,
 * because it always has a real prior status and always writes its own source.
 * Any other producer does have to, so they are stated here:
 *   - An unknown from- or to-state is the sentinel "-", never an empty cell.
 *     funnel-velocity.mjs reads the two columns differently: a from of "-"
 *     parses to null, meaning no prior state, while a to of "-" is preserved
 *     as the literal "-", meaning an unknown target. Any other value goes
 *     through resolveCanonicalState, so an empty cell is rejected as
 *     `unknown from-state ""` or `unknown to-state ""` for its own column,
 *     and the row is dropped.
 *   - The source column is a closed set, and VALID_SOURCES in
 *     funnel-velocity.mjs is the authority on its members. Deliberately not
 *     enumerated here: a copy of that list in prose is wrong the first time a
 *     writer is added, and it would be wrong in three files at once.
 *     A value outside the set parses but is excluded from day-math. The row
 *     is not lost and the exclusion is not silent: it is kept as an
 *     observation, recorded in unknownSources, and printed with its line
 *     number under dataQuality. Namespacing a source (say "backfill:notes")
 *     therefore keeps the row out of the day-math figures; put that detail in
 *     the note column.
