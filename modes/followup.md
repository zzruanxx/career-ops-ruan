# Mode: followup -- Follow-up Cadence Tracker

> **Read `voice-dna.md` (if present) and apply it to every generated email/LinkedIn draft.** This mode is standalone — it does NOT load `_shared.md`, so read `voice-dna.md` directly. Follow-up drafts are conversational, so apply the full guardrail: banned words/phrases/patterns, no em-dashes, no negative parallelisms (§3-4) AND conversational voice — contractions, varied rhythm, direct "I"/"you" (§1-2). Never drop or soften a real metric from `cv.md` for style.

## Purpose

Track follow-up cadence for active applications. Flag overdue follow-ups, extract contacts from notes, and generate tailored follow-up email/LinkedIn drafts using report context.

**Not in scope here:** a same-day follow-up after a recruiter/interviewer
confirmed a specific call time and then didn't call. That's not an
elapsed-time cadence case — see `confirmed_time_noshow` in `modes/email.md`
(`/career-ops email noshow`) instead.

## Inputs

- `data/applications.md` — Application tracker
- `data/active-interviews.md` — Interview round dates (read by Step 1b)
- `data/follow-ups.md` — Follow-up history (created on first use)
- `reports/` — Evaluation reports (for context in drafts)
- `config/profile.yml` — User profile (name, identity)
- `cv.md` — CV for proof points in drafts

## Step 1 — Run Cadence Script

Execute:

```bash
node followup-cadence.mjs
```

Parse the JSON output. It contains:

| Key | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| `metadata` | Analysis date, total tracked, actionable count, overdue/urgent/cold/waiting counts |
| `entries` | Per-application: company, role, status, days since application, follow-up count, urgency, next follow-up date, extracted contacts, report path |
| `cadenceConfig` | Cadence rules (applied: 7 days, responded: 3 days, interview: 1 day) |

If no actionable entries, tell the user:
> "No active applications to follow up on. Apply to some roles first with `/career-ops` and come back when they're aging."

**Calibration cross-reference:** `node funnel-velocity.mjs --summary` reports which in-flight applications sit beyond the typical first-response window (its `waiting` block) — those rows are natural follow-up candidates; feed them into this cadence view rather than treating the wait itself as a verdict (silence past the window is common, not a rejection). When the user reports a status change here ("they replied", "rejected"), route it through `node set-status.mjs <report#> <state>` and pass `--on YYYY-MM-DD` when they name the real event day.

## Step 1b — Employer Response-Latency Check

Execute:

```bash
node rejection-latency.mjs
```

Parse the JSON output. It cross-references `data/active-interviews.md` interview dates with tracker rows still in `Interview` state (matched per application: company + role) and flags applications whose post-interview silence exceeds the **courtesy** threshold (30-day default, configurable via `rejection_latency.courtesy_days` or `--courtesy-days`). If `flags` is empty, skip this step silently.

**Confirmation gate (required before rendering anything from a flag):** a flag's fields come straight from raw tracker/interview-log data, not from anything the user has said in this conversation. Before rendering ANY user-facing content around a flag — the reminder line below, or the `blacklistSuggestion` row — the user must have explicitly stated or confirmed the flag's company, dates (last interview date / days since), and any other field about to be rendered, in the current conversation. This can be as simple as asking "I see {company} flagged at {daysSinceLastInterview} days since your last interview on {lastInterviewDate} — does that match what you remember?" and getting a yes, or the user independently bringing up the same company/dates unprompted. **If the user has not confirmed these details, skip rendering that flag silently** — do not surface the reminder line or the blacklist row from unconfirmed raw tracker data.

Once confirmed, surface one reminder line alongside the Step 2 dashboard:

```text
[Render in {language.output}: "⏳ {company} — {daysSinceLastInterview} days since your last interview ({lastInterviewDate}) with no recorded response. This exceeds the {thresholdDays}-day courtesy threshold."]
```

If the user asks what to do about a confirmed flag, show the flag's ready-made `blacklistSuggestion` row and tell them ([Render in {language.output}]) they can copy it into `data/blacklist.md` themselves — this is a suggestion only. When `language.output` is not English, compose the reminder prose — and, if the user keeps their blacklist reasons in another language, the row's Reason cell — from the flag's structured fields (`reasonCode`, `daysSinceLastInterview`, `thresholdDays`, `lastInterviewDate`) instead of relaying the English `reason` string verbatim; the table's column layout and the literal `company` scope value stay fixed (they must match `data/blacklist.md`'s file format). **Never write to `data/blacklist.md`, `data/applications.md`, or `data/active-interviews.md` from this step** (#1742 opt-in guarantee, same suggestion-only bridge as `modes/interview-redflag.md`).

## Step 2 — Display Dashboard

Show a cadence dashboard sorted by urgency (urgent > overdue > waiting > cold):

```
Follow-up Cadence Dashboard — {date}
{N} applications tracked, {N} actionable

| # | Company | Role | Status | Days | Follow-ups | Next | Urgency | Contact |
```

Use visual indicators:
- **URGENT** — respond within 24 hours (company replied)
- **OVERDUE** — follow-up is past due
- **waiting (X days)** — on track, follow-up scheduled
- **COLD** — 2+ follow-ups sent, suggest closing

## Step 3 — Generate Follow-up Drafts

For each **overdue** or **urgent** entry only:

1. Read the linked report (`reportPath` from JSON) for company context
2. Read `cv.md` for proof points
3. Read `config/profile.yml` for candidate name and identity

**Agency-mediated applications (#1596):** when the entry's `via` field is set (the cadence JSON emits `via: null` for direct applications), the chase target is the **agency contact** (recruiter named in the notes/contacts), not the company — the recruiter owns the client relationship and has their own incentive to respond. Reference the role by the agency's framing.

**When the end employer is unknown (company `?`), this branch REPLACES the framework rules below — do not fall through to them.** There is no company name to mention and nothing company-specific to reference, so instead:
- Sentence 1 references the role by the **agency's framing** (their listing title + the recruiter's name) **plus when you applied** — the application date stays in the opening exactly as the framework requires; only the company reference is replaced, never with a placeholder company name.
- Sentence 2's value-add draws on cv.md/report proof points that fit the role as listed — skip the "specific to THAT company" rule.
- Add the client-name ask: request the end employer's name as a natural part of the follow-up ("so I can prepare properly, could you share which company this role is with?") — that reveal is what unlocks cross-channel dedup in the tracker.

When `via` is set but the employer IS known, use the framework below unchanged except the recipient: address the recruiter, mention the client company by name.

### Email Follow-up Framework (first follow-up, followupCount == 0)

Generate a 3-4 sentence email:

1. **Sentence 1:** Reference the specific role + when you applied. Be specific — mention the company name and role title.
2. **Sentence 2:** One concrete value-add from the report's Block B match or a proof point from cv.md. Quantify if possible.
3. **Sentence 3:** Soft ask + availability. Offer a specific time window ("this week" or "next Tuesday").
4. **Sentence 4 (optional):** Brief mention of a relevant recent project or achievement.

**Rules:**
- Professional but warm, NOT desperate
- **NEVER** use "just checking in", "just following up", "touching base", or "circling back"
- Lead with value, not with the ask
- Reference something specific to THAT company (from report Block A)
- Keep under 150 words
- Include a subject line
- Use the candidate's name from `config/profile.yml`

**Example tone:**
> Subject: Re: Senior PHP/Laravel Developer — IxDF
>
> Hi [contact name or "team"],
>
> I submitted my application for the Senior PHP/Laravel Developer role on April 7th. I wanted to share that my production Laravel app (Barbeiro.app — 120 models, 315 API endpoints, full test suite) closely mirrors the TDD-driven culture described in the posting.
>
> I'd love to discuss how my 15 years of PHP experience and hands-on AI tooling workflow could contribute to IxDF's platform. Would any time this week work for a brief conversation?
>
> Best,
> [Name]

### LinkedIn Follow-up (if no email contact found)

Reuse the contacto framework: 3 sentences, 300 character max.
- Hook specific to company → proof point → soft ask
- Suggest the user run `/career-ops contacto {company}` to find the right person first

### Second Follow-up (followupCount == 1)

Shorter than first (2-3 sentences). Take a **new angle**:
- Share a relevant insight, article, or project update
- Don't repeat the first follow-up's content
- Still reference the role specifically

### Cold Application (followupCount >= 2)

Do NOT generate another follow-up. Instead suggest:
> "This application has had {N} follow-ups with no response. Consider:
> - Updating status to `Discarded` if the role seems filled
> - Trying a different contact via `/career-ops contacto`
> - Keeping in `Applied` status but deprioritizing"

### Company history context (optional)

Before drafting, check the company's card. Skip this lookup entirely when the tracker's company field is `?` (the unknown-employer marker — there is no meaningful card to fetch). Otherwise run `node company-history.mjs --company <company>`, passing the company name as its own single, quoted argument — never splice it into a longer shell string, since company names can legitimately contain quotes, `$`, backticks, or `;`. If `responsiveness.label` is `silent-on-you`, set expectations rather than discouraging the follow-up: many processes are genuinely just slow, so mention this plainly and suggest capping further time investment in this company if it stays silent after this attempt. The decision to send — and how many more times — stays the user's; never skip or downgrade a follow-up because of this label. Follow-up compliance is never punished.

## Step 4 — Present Drafts

For each draft, show:

```
## Follow-up: {Company} — {Role} (#{num})

**To:** {email or "No contact found — run `/career-ops contacto` first"}
**Subject:** {subject line}
**Days since application:** {N}
**Follow-ups sent:** {N}
**Channel:** Email / LinkedIn

{draft text}
```

## Step 5 — Record Follow-ups

After the user reviews and says they've sent a follow-up, record it:

1. If `data/follow-ups.md` doesn't exist, create it (this exact header — the
   same one the web UI writes; `followup-cadence.mjs` parses these columns):

   ```markdown
   # Follow-ups

   | num | appNum | date | company | role | channel | contact | notes |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   ```

2. Append a row with:
   - `num` = next sequential number in the follow-ups table
   - `appNum` = application number from tracker
   - `date` = today's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `company` = company name
   - `role` = role title
   - `channel` = Email / LinkedIn / Phone / Other
   - `contact` = who it was sent to
   - `notes` = brief note (e.g., "First follow-up, referenced Barbeiro.app")

3. Optionally update the Notes column in `data/applications.md` with "Follow-up {N} sent {YYYY-MM-DD}"

**IMPORTANT:** Only record follow-ups the user confirms they actually sent. Never record a draft as sent.

### Pinned next dates & automatic seeding

`data/follow-ups.md` also supports pin lines that override the computed
schedule for a single application:

```text
- next #42 2026-07-10 (set 2026-07-02)
```

`#42` is the application number, the first date is the pinned NEXT follow-up
date, and `(set …)` is the day the pin was made. Pins take precedence over
the computed schedule until a follow-up is logged on or after the set-date;
the latest pin per application wins; deleting the line clears the pin.

Pins may be seeded AUTOMATICALLY when an application turns Applied —
`node followup-seed.mjs <num>` (run by the `apply` mode's Step 9) appends a
pin scheduling the first follow-up at apply date + the `applied_first`
cadence. Seeding is idempotent, and a stale pin left behind by a later
Rejected/Discarded transition is harmless because the cadence analysis
ignores non-actionable statuses.

## Step 6 — Summary

After showing all drafts, summarize:

> **Follow-up Dashboard** ({date})
> - {N} applications being tracked
> - {N} overdue — drafts generated above
> - {N} urgent — respond today
> - {N} waiting — next follow-up dates shown
> - {N} cold — consider closing
>
> Review the drafts above and tell me which ones you've sent so I can record them.

## Cadence Rules Reference

| Status | First follow-up | Subsequent | Max attempts |
|--------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Applied | 7 days after application | Every 7 days | 2 (then mark cold) |
| Responded | 1 day (urgent reply) | Every 3 days | No limit |
| Interview | 1 day after (thank-you) | Every 3 days | No limit |

These defaults can be overridden via `node followup-cadence.mjs --applied-days N`.
