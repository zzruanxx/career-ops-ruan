// portal-health-lock.mjs — a cross-process advisory lock for
// data/portal-health.tsv, so appendPortalHealth() (scan.mjs) and any
// read-modify-write cleanup of the same file (tests/portal-health-guard.mjs)
// can never interleave. A concurrent appender that lands between a cleanup's
// read and write would otherwise be silently discarded.
//
// Protocol — deliberately the same shape as the tracker lock in
// tracker-utils.mjs, so there is one lock idiom in the codebase:
//   - the lock is a directory ("<path>.lock"); a mkdir is atomic.
//   - the holder records owner.json — pid, a unique token, started_at — so
//     both stale-reclaim and release can verify who actually owns the lock
//     before deleting anything.
//   - staleness is judged by owner-PID liveness first, falling back to
//     directory age only when the metadata is missing or unreadable. An old
//     lock whose owner is still running is NOT stale.
//   - stale reclamation is serialized behind a second atomic guard directory
//     ("<path>.lock.recover"). Without it, reclamation is itself a TOCTOU
//     race: two callers that both judge the same lock stale can have the
//     second one's rmSync delete the first one's freshly created lock, after
//     which both believe they hold it — reintroducing the very interleaving
//     this module exists to prevent, just gated behind a crash + contention
//     window.
//
// Timing is caller-configurable (with these defaults) so tests can exercise
// contention in milliseconds instead of waiting out a multi-second constant.
