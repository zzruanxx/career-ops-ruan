/**
 * invite-match.mjs — Interview-Invite / Rejection → Tracker Matcher for career-ops
 *
 * Recruiter calendar/ATS invite emails frequently name only the company
 * (generic subject lines like "Schedule Your Phone Screen") with no job
 * title or req number. Finding which `data/applications.md` row an invite
 * belongs to otherwise means a manual grep every time. Rejection emails —
 * the single most common ATS-generated email — have the exact same problem,
 * and are the more frequent case in practice (#2098).
 *
 * This script extracts a company name (and, if present, a date, a
 * req/job-ID-looking token, and a call platform/medium) from pasted invite
 * text, fuzzy-matches it against the tracker's Company column, and ranks
 * candidates when the same company has multiple applications — which is
 * common. A silent wrong guess is worse than showing a short ranked list,
 * so ambiguous input always returns all plausible candidates rather than
 * picking one. The text is also classified as `invite` / `rejection` /
 * `unknown` (see classifyEmail) — informational only, never a gate on
 * matching.
 *
 * Despite the filename, this now recognizes more than interview invites
 * (#2098). Kept as-is rather than renamed: a rename would break any doc or
 * script that already references `invite-match.mjs` (e.g. #1495's own
 * history) — left as a maintainer call, not blocking.
 *
 * Run: node invite-match.mjs < invite.txt          (JSON to stdout)
 *      node invite-match.mjs --file invite.txt
 *      echo "..." | node invite-match.mjs --summary
 *      node invite-match.mjs --apply [--id N]      (rejection-classified matches only; advances status to Rejected)
 *      node invite-match.mjs --self-test
 *

// A meeting-platform URL is unambiguous, so these are checked in a fixed
// order and the first hit wins — no scoring needed, unlike company-name
// matching where several candidates can plausibly overlap.
//
// Each pattern requires a proper URL/host boundary, not just a substring
// match: an optional scheme + single subdomain label ahead of the host, a
// real host-boundary character (or start-of-string) before that, and a
// path/query/fragment/whitespace delimiter (or end-of-string) after the
// host. This rejects lookalike hosts (`notzoom.us`, `teams.microsoft.com.evil.
// example`) and email addresses (`support@zoom.us`) that merely contain the
// host string as a substring — "silence stays silence" per this file's
// extractDate/extractReqId convention, so a lookalike is never reported as
// a real meeting platform.
//
// The prefix boundary also excludes URL-structure characters (`/ ? = & #`)
// so a platform host is only recognized at the true start of a URL
// authority, not when it's actually a path segment or query value on a
// *different* host: `https://example.com/zoom.us` (path segment) and
// `https://example.com?next=zoom.us` (query value) must NOT match, since
// `zoom.us` is not the URL's actual host in either case.
//
// An optional explicit port (`:443`, `:8443`, etc.) is permitted between
// the host and the following delimiter, since a URL authority may legally
// include one (`https://zoom.us:443/j/123456789`) and rejecting it would
// silently drop otherwise-legitimate invite links.
// The `isAIInterviewer` flag distinguishes AI-interviewer platforms (#2673)
// — where the candidate talks live to an AI system instead of a human —
// from the human-mediated platforms above. It does NOT change
// extractPlatform()'s return contract (still a plain platform-name string);
// it's read separately by isAIInterviewerPlatform() below so existing
// extractPlatform() callers are unaffected.
//
// This flag is a best-effort heuristic tied to extractPlatform()'s own
// first-match resolution, NOT a guarantee that the host is exclusively
// AI-led: isAIInterviewerPlatform() below derives its answer from whichever
// pattern actually wins the same ordered scan extractPlatform() runs, so the
// two agree by construction. Alex/Apriora is flagged `true` for a clean
// single-link Alex match, but Alex is itself multi-modal in practice — it
// also sells a "Coordinator" product that schedules and sends calendar
// invites for human-conducted rounds, so an alex.com link can legitimately
// appear on an invite to a human interview (#2676 review, santifer). When a
// human-platform link (Zoom, Teams, etc.) is also present and wins the scan,
// the match resolves to that human platform and this flag is `false` for
// that invite, even though alex.com appears somewhere in the text. HireVue
// is flagged `false` unconditionally: its `hirevue.com` hosts serve
// on-demand recorded screening, live human-conducted interviews scheduled
// through the platform, and a separate "AI Interviewer" product, all under
// the same domain, with no public discriminator (subdomain, path) that

 * a `rejection` classification before `--apply` performs its irreversible
 * tracker write (#2098, CodeRabbit review on PR #2100).
 *
 * Rejection requires either a strong phrase (unambiguous on its own) or two
 * distinct corroborating-only phrases together — a single corroborating-only
 * phrase (e.g. "unfortunately") is never sufficient by itself, since it is
 * common in unrelated professional correspondence (reschedules, delays) and
 * a false `rejection` is the unsafe misclassification direction here.
 *
 * Informational only — never a gate on matching. An email that mentions both
 * (e.g. a rejection that references an earlier phone screen: "Thank you for
 * interviewing with us. Unfortunately, we regret to inform you...") is
 * classified `rejection`: that language is the more decisive signal of the
 * two, and it is also the only classification the --apply path acts on.
 *
 * `phraseStrength` reports whether a `rejection` classification was driven by
 * a strong (unambiguous-on-its-own) phrase or only by weak corroborating
 * phrases — the `--apply` confidence gate on a sole fuzzy-matched candidate
 * requires `'strong'` before auto-writing Rejected (#2100 CodeRabbit review,
