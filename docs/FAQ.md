## 1. Skills aren't loading on Windows — symlink error on install

Windows does not create symlinks by default, so Git checks out the CLI skill entrypoints (`.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/`, etc.) as plain pointer files instead of real symlinks. The installer and updater both detect this automatically: run `node update-system.mjs apply` (or `npx @santifer/career-ops init` on a fresh install) and the `materializeSkillEntrypoints` step will replace the pointer files with the full canonical skill content. No manual `mklink` or Developer Mode changes are needed.

## 2. What is the difference between `scan` and `scan:full`?

`npm run scan` is the standard portal scanner — it reads the companies you have configured in `portals.yml`, hits their ATS APIs (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever) directly, and consumes zero LLM tokens. Use it for your regular daily or weekly discovery run. `npm run scan:full` inverts the direction: instead of scanning your curated list, it walks public ATS company directories and surfaces any fresh postings that match your `title_filter` / `location_filter`, so you catch roles from companies you haven't manually added to `portals.yml`. Run `scan:full` when you want broader discovery beyond your tracked list.

## 3. How do I avoid hitting token or rate limits during a batch run?

Pass `--limit <N>` to `batch-runner.sh` to cap the number of offers processed in a single run (e.g. `./batch/batch-runner.sh --limit 5`) — this lets you inspect output quality before committing to a larger run. If a run is interrupted mid-way by a rate limit or network error, do not restart from scratch; use `./batch/batch-runner.sh --resume-paused` to skip already-completed jobs and pick up where you left off, avoiding wasted tokens on work that finished successfully.

## 4. Can I run career-ops on a cheaper or local model?

Yes — career-ops is fully AI-agnostic and works with any AI coding CLI or standalone script. See [docs/RUNNING_ON_A_BUDGET.md](RUNNING_ON_A_BUDGET.md) for a full guide covering OpenCode, Qwen CLI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ollama, and other local or low-cost providers, along with recommended model sizes and token-saving best practices.

**For zero cost specifically**, see [docs/FREE_TIER.md](FREE_TIER.md): career-ops runs on Antigravity CLI's free tier with no API key and no paid subscription, within Google's daily caps.

**And if you already pay for a plan but are being billed per token anyway**, that is usually an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment taking precedence over your subscription: see [the subscription section of the budget guide](RUNNING_ON_A_BUDGET.md#2b-already-paying-for-a-subscription-make-sure-you-are-using-it).

## 5. What does the "possible cross-listing" warning mean during a scan?

When the scanner shows a warning like:

```
⚠ Possible cross-listing: Acme Corp / Senior AI Engineer ↔ TalentBridge / Senior AI Engineer (similarity 0.96)
```

it means the job description text of two listings from **different companies** is nearly identical — typically because a recruitment agency has re-posted a direct employer's role with the employer name removed or replaced.

**Why it matters:** if you apply through both channels, both the agency and the employer will see your application independently. This is known as a double-submission and it can damage your relationship with the hiring team.

**What to do:**

1. Read both listings and confirm one is a direct company post and the other is an agency re-post.
2. Choose ONE channel to apply through. Applying direct is usually safer; applying via an agency can be useful if the agency has a relationship with the hiring manager.
3. If the two listings turn out to be genuinely different roles that happen to share boilerplate text (e.g. a generic engineering role template), the warning is a false positive — you can ignore it and apply to both.

**Technical note:** the scanner computes a 64-bit SimHash fingerprint of each JD body and stores it in the 8th column of `data/scan-history.tsv` (`jd_fingerprint`). Fingerprints are computed locally from text already returned by the ATS API — no extra network request is made. Postings without a usable description never receive a fingerprint and are never flagged. See [docs/SCRIPTS.md](SCRIPTS.md#cross-listing-detection) for the full column reference.

## 6. Can I use my own CV template?

Yes. Set `cv.template` (and/or `cover_letter.template`) in `config/profile.yml` to the kebab-case name of a template file in `templates/` — a value of `modern` resolves to `templates/cv-template.modern.html` (cover letters use `templates/cover-letter-template.<name>.html`). Leave the field unset and career-ops falls back to the built-in default template (`templates/cv-template.html`). You can also pick a template per generation just by asking (e.g. "use the modern template"). See the commented `cv.template` / `cover_letter.template` fields in `config/profile.example.yml` for the full reference.

## How do I stop a company from showing up in scans?

Copy `templates/blacklist.example.md` to `data/blacklist.md`, then list one company per line.

If a listed company is encountered, the scan reports that it was skipped (never silently). You can bypass the filter with `--include-blacklisted` if you want to audit matching postings.

See the Company blacklist section in `docs/SCRIPTS.md` for the full behavior and supported workflow.

## What's the difference between `Discarded` and `SKIP`?

From `templates/states.yml`: `Discarded` is "discarded by candidate or offer closed" (you considered it and stopped), `SKIP` is "doesn't fit, don't apply" (never a candidate). They land in different dashboard groups, so they count differently in your funnel: SKIP is filtering, Discarded is dropping out.

## Is there only one CV template?

No. `templates/` has `cv-template.html`, `cv-template.tex` (LaTeX/Overleaf), `cv-template.zh-minimal.html`, `resume-template.html`, `cover-letter-template.html`, plus `templates/sections/`. See also "Can I use my own CV template?" above.

## Why does Chrome open during some scans but not others?

Chromium only launches with `--verify`. A normal scan reads public ATS APIs and needs no browser; `--verify` checks a posting is genuinely still live, which needs a real page load. If it fails, the error asks you to run `npx playwright install chromium`.

## Can I run career-ops in Docker / self-hosted?

Yes: there's a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` in the repo root. Note that career-ops is local-first and human-in-the-loop, so Docker packages the environment: it does not turn career-ops into a service that runs on its own or applies to jobs for you.

## Does career-ops sync across devices?

No. Everything is files in your checkout, and there is no cloud component. People who want this put the directory in a synced folder.

## How do I get an issue assigned to me?

Comment on it and we'll assign it (this is in CONTRIBUTING.md). A PR with no prior issue is welcome for bug fixes, zero-auth scanner providers, docs and translations. Issue-first applies only to new features, new modes and architecture changes.

## Can I use career-ops without a terminal?

Yes: see [`docs/COWORK.md`](COWORK.md) which covers running it inside Claude Cowork, verified end to end. One step people trip on: Cowork's shell has no npm network access, so clone and `npm install` in a terminal *before* opening the folder.
