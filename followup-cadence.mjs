 * Whether the apply-date at `index` is being cited ABOUT ANOTHER ROW.
 *
 * Heuristic, and deliberately a narrow one: a `#NNN` row reference shortly
 * before the date, with no sentence boundary between them, means the date is
 * inside that reference's clause. A sentence break ends the reference's scope,
 * so "Sibling #140 was slow. Applied 2026-08-06." is correctly read as this
 * row's own date.
 *
 * A SEMICOLON OR PIPE IS A BOUNDARY ONLY ONCE THE REFERENCE HAS ITS OWN DATE.
 * These are the separators this Notes column actually uses, and they do two
 * different jobs depending on what came before:
 *
 *   "#154 Sr PM (applied 2026-08-04); applied 2026-06-15"
 *        the citation already carries its date, so the second one is a new
 *        subject — this row's own. Reading the whole note as #154's discards a
 *        real measured date, and this is the MORE common shape: two roles live
 *        at one employer, and the note naming the sibling is usually the same
 *        note that records this submission.
 *
 *   "#154 is already live; applied 2026-08-04"
 *        the citation has no date yet, so the one after the separator is still
 *        its own — a semicolon joins independent clauses within a sentence and
 *        the subject carries across it. Treating it as a break here adopts a
 *        foreign date and reports it as MEASURED.
 *
 * Where the reading is genuinely ambiguous the tie goes to "cross-referenced",
 * because the two errors are not symmetric — a false positive degrades to a
 * fallback that is LABELLED as not-measured, while a false negative reports
 * another row's date as this row's measured one.
 *
 * Both failure directions are survivable, which is why a heuristic is
 * acceptable here: a false positive degrades to the evaluation date, labelled
 * as a fallback by both consumers (see the note in parseAppliedDate), and a
 * false negative is just the pre-#2607 behaviour. Neither invents a date.
