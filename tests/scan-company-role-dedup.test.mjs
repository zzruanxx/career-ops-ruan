// tests/scan-company-role-dedup.test.mjs — the company+role dedupe key must
// survive between scan runs.
//
// `loadSeenUrls` reads all three dedupe sources (scan-history.tsv, pipeline.md,
// applications.md). Its company+role counterpart read applications.md alone, so
// the role key was effectively intra-run: a role surfaced by a prior scan lives
// in scan-history and pipeline, and does not reach applications.md until the
// user evaluates and applies it. Companies that open one req per city therefore
// leaked one city variant per scan — run 1 added the Costa Mesa req (marking the
// key in memory only), run 2 re-seeded from applications.md, found the key
// absent, and the DC req cleared both the URL check and the role check.
//
// The unit checks exercise `loadSeenCompanyRoles` (the filesystem wrapper)
// rather than the pure collector, because the defect was in which sources get
// wired in, not in how any one source is parsed. The last check is end-to-end —
// two real `scan.mjs` runs over a fixture board — because the defect is in the
// wiring between the loader and main(), which no unit test observes.
