//
// `CAREER_OPS_PORTALS` and `CAREER_OPS_PROFILE` already let a second search lane
// bring its own targeting, but data/pipeline.md and data/scan-history.tsv were
// hardcoded, so every lane landed in one inbox. The quiet half is dedup:
// scan-history.tsv is the dedup source, so a posting surfaced by lane A is
// skipped as a duplicate in lane B and never reaches the user at all - the
// counter increments and no row appears.
//
// End-to-end rather than unit, because the defect is in module-level path
// resolution: importing the module in-process would read this process's env, not
// a lane's. Each check spawns a real scan.mjs over the local-parser fixture
// board, so nothing here touches the network.
