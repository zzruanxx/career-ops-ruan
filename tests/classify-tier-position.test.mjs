// tests/classify-tier-position.test.mjs — which level marker wins when a title
// carries more than one.
//
// classifyTier resolved conflicts by SENIORITY RANK: senior(4) > mid(3) >
// entry(2) > intern(1), highest wins. Real titles break that, because the
// senior-sounding word is usually naming the team, office or person the role
// sits next to, not the role's own level — "Summer Intern, Director of
// Product" is an internship, not a directorship. Every such title classified
// `senior`.
//
// It matters because scan.mjs:2396 drops a posting outright when its tier is in
// `skip_tiers`, with no log line naming it. A junior candidate skipping
// `senior` therefore lost exactly the internships they were scanning for.
//
// The rule under test is POSITION: English job titles put the level first, so
// the LEFTMOST marker is the role's own. That also keeps "Senior Intern
// Coordinator" senior — a role that manages interns, where `senior` genuinely
// leads the title.
