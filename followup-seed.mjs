/**
 * followup-seed.mjs — Seed data/follow-ups.md when a row is marked Applied (#1430)
 *
 * WHY: the follow-up system was "born dead". Marking a tracker row Applied only
 * updated applications.md — data/follow-ups.md stayed empty until the user ran
 * the `followup` mode by hand and it happened to notice the row. In practice
 * that meant most applications never got a scheduled next-follow-up date at
 * all, silently defeating the entire cadence feature. This script closes that
 * gap: given an appNum (or --backfill for the whole tracker), it computes the
 * cadence-default next-follow-up date and writes it as a PIN DIRECTIVE line —
 * never a table row, because a table row in follow-ups.md means "a follow-up
 * was SENT", which seeding must not claim.
 *
 * Pin format (parsed by `parseNextOverrides` in followup-cadence.mjs):
 *   - next #<appNum> <YYYY-MM-DD> (set <YYYY-MM-DD>)
 * First date = seeded next-follow-up date. `(set …)` = the day the pin was
 * written. The LAST pin per application wins, so re-seeding with --force is
 * always safe — it just appends a fresh pin.
 *
 * Apply-date resolution order (see resolveAppliedDate): explicit --date, then
 * "Applied YYYY-MM-DD" in the row's notes, then the tracker's `date` column,
 * then today. Every result carries an `appDateSource` saying which of those it
 * came from, so a measured date is never mistaken for a guessed one.
 *
 * The `date` column used to be excluded here as "the evaluation date, not the
 * submission date". It is — but the fallback it was being excluded in favour of
 * was `today`, which is worse: an early date makes a follow-up fire early
 * (visible), while today makes an old application look new and silently resets
 * its follow-up clock (not visible). Preferring the labelled proxy over the
 * unlabelled guess is the trade that replaced it (#2607).
 *
 * Idempotency: by default, seeding a given appNum is a NO-OP FOREVER once
 * either a pin or a follow-up table row exists for it (exit 0, seeded:false).
 * Pass --force to append a fresh pin anyway.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node followup-seed.mjs <appNum> [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--force] [--dry-run] [--json]
 *   node followup-seed.mjs --backfill [--dry-run] [--json]
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 success or idempotent no-op
 *   1 usage or validation error (incl. impossible --date, non-Applied row
 *     without --force, unknown flag)
 *   2 row not found (or tracker missing)
 *   4 lock timeout
 *
 * Env overrides (mirroring merge-tracker.mjs / followup-cadence.mjs):
 *   CAREER_OPS_TRACKER                     tracker path
 *   CAREER_OPS_FOLLOWUPS                   follow-ups path

 * The `date` column used to be excluded on the grounds that it is the

 * conclusion, because the alternative was `todayStr()` — and today is not a
 * neutral default here, it is the single most damaging guess available:

 *   - the evaluation date is early by however long the user took to apply,
 *     which makes a follow-up fire early. Visible, and harmless.
 *   - today makes the application look brand new, which silently RESETS the

 *     chase queue, and the pin looks exactly like a normal fresh entry.
 *
 * A wrong date you can see beats a wrong date you cannot, so the proxy is now
 * preferred over the guess and `appDateSource` says which one you got. That
 * matches followup-cadence.mjs's `resolveAppliedDate` (same fallback, same
 * labelling) and company-history.mjs's `dateBasis`, so all three agree.

 *
 *   2. It is NOT reentrant. Holding this lock and then invoking a core script
 *      that also takes it (`followup-seed.mjs` itself) self-deadlocks until the
 *      timeout. Callers that write the file directly are safe; callers that
 *      orchestrate core scripts must not wrap them in this.
