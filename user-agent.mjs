// career-ops-liveness/1.0 — no known reason for the distinct identifiers,
// treated as copy-paste drift, not intentional server-side traffic splitting).
//
// The trailing /1.0 is a UA-format version, bumped by hand only if this
// identifier's shape changes (same convention as Googlebot/2.1, bingbot/2.0)
// — it is NOT the package.json release version. A UA that moved on every
// release would be an unintended variable in every provider's fingerprint,
// introduced without anyone deciding it should be there. Pin it.
